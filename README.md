### 👋 About Me

I am Siddhartha Ganguly(XYZ).

I am deeply interested in technical things and love solving problems.

I don’t have one specific coding language I call “my favorite” — given the right resources, I can code in almost any popular programming language out there.

I may not be very knowledgeable in tech yet, but my goal is clear: **whatever the problem is, I am going to solve it.** I will keep trying, learning, and iterating until it’s done. Most of the time the challenge is new to me — and that’s the most exciting part! I get to learn something new while solving it.

I am always adaptable and eager to embrace shifts and changes in the tech field.

Currently, I’m exploring **AI, Machine Learning, Robotics, and Crypto**. A few years from now, I hope to add exciting fields like **Quantum Computing, Space Tech, and many more**.

### 💡 My Approach to Programming

For me, coding or programming is more about **real-world problem solving** than just writing code. I focus on problem solving.

For languages, I rely on resources to gain knowledge and always stay up-to-date with the latest developments, modifications, or new packages added. I try my best to solve the problem in any programming language to the best of my ability. I do study popular workspace languages though, but my goal is problem solving — whether pre-known or completely unknown.
